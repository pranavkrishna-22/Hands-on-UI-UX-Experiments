# Hands-on UI/UX Experiments

This repository contains a set of hands-on experiments focused on learning and applying User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX) design principles. These activities cover wireframing, prototyping, usability testing, accessibility checks, and navigation design — all essential skills for aspiring designers and developers.

---

## Objective

To provide structured, practice-based learning for UI/UX principles through real-world design problems. These experiments are ideal for students, beginner designers, or developers aiming to build better user-centered products.

---

## Overview of Experiments

### 1. Login Page Redesign
- **Aim:** Improve the usability, clarity, and visual hierarchy of a basic login page.
- **Process:**
  - Analyze existing login UIs.
  - Identify usability flaws using heuristics.
  - Sketch wireframes.
  - Design a high-fidelity mockup.
  - Conduct user testing and gather feedback.
- **Tools:** Figma, Heuristic Evaluation Checklist, User Interviews

### 2. Mobile App Navigation Flow
- **Aim:** Redesign the navigation system of a sample mobile app for better usability.
- **Process:**
  - Conduct card sorting exercises.
  - Map current vs. proposed navigation flows.
  - Design new flow using user-centered principles.
  - Test with users using clickable prototypes.
- **Tools:** Figma, Miro (for mapping), OptimalSort (card sorting)

### 3. Usability Testing of an Existing Website Feature
- **Aim:** Evaluate how easily users can perform specific tasks on a website (e.g., placing an order, applying filters).
- **Process:**
  - Choose a feature.
  - Design usability test scenarios.
  - Record user sessions (screen + audio).
  - Use the System Usability Scale (SUS) for evaluation.
- **Tools:** Maze, Lookback, Google Forms

### 4. Color and Contrast Accessibility Audit
- **Aim:** Make UI components accessible to people with visual impairments, especially color blindness.
- **Process:**
  - Use tools to check contrast ratios.
  - Adjust UI components as per WCAG 2.1 guidelines.
  - Simulate color blindness scenarios.
- **Tools:** WebAIM Contrast Checker, Stark Plugin (Figma), WCAG Reference
